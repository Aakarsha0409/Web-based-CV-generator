# Web-based-CV-generator
I work in a premier IT training school in Michigan, US (remote). The enrolled veterans are always looking to create resumes to start their corportate journey. This is an easy way to build a resume. I created it using Django.

This project is a web-based CV (Curriculum Vitae) generator built using the Django framework. Users can easily create and customize their CVs through a user-friendly interface.

Features - 
- User authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
- CV customization: Users can add, edit, and delete sections of their CV, such as personal information, education, work experience, skills, etc.
- PDF export: Users can export their CVs to PDF format for easy sharing and printing.
